I bought a secondhand exercise bike and unfortunatly the little computer that tracks distance, speed etc. died on my second day of ownership. However the internal electronic components are still intact and can interface with an arduino. 

An arduino will track the revolutions and pass the data to a raspberry pi via serial. Further processing to be carried out on the pi. I may create a web application which would allow for logging and live tracking and maybe some other interesting features too. 

I am aware that the pi could be used to interface with the electronic components directly but during testing I Was getting a lot of electronic interference so I'ms sticking with the arduino.
